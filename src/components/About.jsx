              I am a dedicated and reliable professional with over 20 years of
              experience working in healthcare logistics, supply chain, and
              fast-paced operational environments. Currently working as a
              Distribution Clerk at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland, I
              specialize in inventory management, supply distribution, and
              supporting medical teams to ensure departments have the resources
              they need to provide quality patient care.

              instrument sterilization, infection control, and healthcare safety
              practices. My goal is to continue growing within the healthcare
              field and contribute to safe and efficient patient care
              environments.

              Flexibility is key, as we understand the demanding schedules of
              working Sterile Technician. Medtek College Hayward provides
              flexible learning options, allowing Sterile Processing to access
              educational materials at their convenience.

              Outside of work and school, I enjoy watching anime and staying
              connected with pop culture. In my free time, I also enjoy spending
              time with my family, building LEGO sets, riding my bike, and
              working on cars, which help me relax and recharge after busy days.
