            As part of my training in sterile processing, I am currently working
            on a project focused on sterilizers used in the Sterile Processing
            Department. This project is designed to help improve my
            understanding of sterilization processes, equipment operation, and
            the important role sterilizers play in maintaining patient safety.
            Through this learning experience, I am developing the knowledge and
            skills needed to support proper instrument decontamination,
            sterilization, and infection prevention in healthcare settings.
