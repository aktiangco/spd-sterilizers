              Sterilization is a critical process in healthcare that completely
              destroys or eliminates all forms of microorganisms, including
              bacteria, viruses, fungi, and bacterial spores, from medical
              instruments and devices. It is essential for ensuring that
              surgical instruments are safe to use on patients and for
              preventing infections during medical procedures. One of the most
              common methods used in hospitals is steam sterilization, which
              uses high-temperature steam under pressure to effectively kill
              microorganisms. For sterilization to be successful, specific
              conditions such as the correct temperature, pressure, and exposure
              time must be achieved and maintained throughout the sterilization
              cycle. Proper packaging is also important because it allows the
              sterilizing agent to penetrate the instruments while maintaining
              sterility after the process is complete. To verify that
              sterilization has been effective, sterile processing departments
              use monitoring methods such as mechanical indicators that track
              cycle conditions, chemical indicators that show exposure to
              sterilization parameters, and biological indicators that confirm
              the destruction of microorganisms. Sterilization plays a vital
              role in maintaining patient safety and preventing
              healthcare-associated infections.
